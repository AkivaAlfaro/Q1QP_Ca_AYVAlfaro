                <h1>Intro to FC 24: </h1>
                <p>FC 24 is a football-based video game published by EA Sports. The goal of this game is to collect football players from store packs,
                build your strongest team, and become the best in matches against other players from around the world. In-game currencies include FIFA 
                coins, which can be earned through rewards, selling valuable players, and completing milestone quests, and FIFA points, which can only 
                be earned by paying with real money digitally though they can also be earned every first season, which resets every year, of the game's update.
                The picture on the right is a set of Xabi Alonso's FC 24 cards in its sample form. It is not yet official but we can get a glimpse of what his
                card will look like upon its release in the game's update in the future.

                <p>Position Ditributions are now interpreted in the pie chart and bar graph on the left. This way, we can easily find the best position suited
                for the shooting skill. The position with the highest amount of players is the Center Back or CB by 17.6% and their role is to defend the back line from goals of the opponents.
                The positions with the least amount of players are the Center Forward, or CF, the Left Back, or LB, and the Left Winger, or the LW and each are 2% out of the entire positions list. 
                Center Forwards assist in creating goals for the Strikers and help defend the midfield. Left Backs are defenders on the left side of the back line while Left Wingers are 
                attackers on the left side of the field's front line. The position that is responsible for scoring goals is the Striker or ST.

                <h1>Conclusion: </h1>
                <p>To conclude, SHO, or shooting, is a basic skill in football. This is used to score goals and help the team win. There a variety of goals such as a power shot, a 
                header, a trivela, and so much more. The image to the right shows that the Class with the highest frequency of SHO is Class 67-75 and the Class with the
                lowest frequency is Class 40-48. From the data we've collected so far, we can now conclude that Center Backs, or CB, are the position to have a low, SHO 
                rating from 67-75, and that Strikers, or ST, are the position to have a higher, SHO rating from 85-93. Therefore, Strikers are better in shooting than 
                Center Backs because both positions have a different training routine based on their roles on the field which is either to attack or defend.
